## SCP-SatComPlate Project Rules

These project-specific rules override the generic upstream ns-3 guidance below
for all SatCompute branches and GitHub workflows.

The `main` branch is based on the official ns-3.48 tag. The permanent
`legacy/ns-3.33` branch preserves the previous SatCompute implementation and
must not be merged into `main` as an unrelated history.

Project-specific code belongs in `contrib/satcompute/`; do not modify upstream
`src/` modules unless a separately reviewed upstream-compatible change is
required. SatCompute models satellites and inter-satellite links only. Ground
stations, feeder links, the frontend transport, fault execution, IPv6, and
SRv6 are outside the current implementation scope.

SatCompute-owned tests and fixtures stay under
`contrib/satcompute/tests/{unit,integration,fixtures,support}`. Each increment
must build, pass its focused tests, and leave the worktree clean before it is
committed. Preserve fixture content unless a task explicitly changes its
contract.

Configure project work with `./ns3 configure --enable-modules=satcompute`.
Do not enable ns-3's global examples or test suites in SatCompute configuration
or GitHub CI, and do not run `test.py` or upstream example tests there. Project
verification consists of the targeted module build plus the maintained tests
under `contrib/satcompute/tests/`.

The versioned scenario JSON is the sole source of simulation semantics. Every
schema property must have a useful JSON Schema `description`, explicit units,
and closed-world validation. Human-facing durations use seconds; loaders must
convert them once to exact integer nanoseconds before scheduling events.
Relative input paths resolve from the scenario file, never from the shell
working directory. Every run writes its resolved effective configuration.

The online simulator and offline trace generator must share orbit, candidate
link, distance-gate, and delay implementations. Stable external satellite IDs
must not depend on ns-3 `Node::GetId()`. Periodic network updates always refresh
distance-mode delays, but global routes are recomputed only when the effective
active-link set changes. A future fault event is an asynchronous nanosecond
event and will bypass the periodic cadence.

Use small `agent/*` branches and pull requests. After a PR is merged and its
head is confirmed reachable from `main`, delete the corresponding local and
remote feature branch. Never delete `legacy/ns-3.33`.

## Project Overview

ns-3 is a discrete-event network simulator for Internet systems, written in C++ with Python bindings. The project uses CMake for building but provides a custom `ns3` wrapper script for easier command-line usage.

## Build System

### Essential Commands

**Configuration:**

```bash
./ns3 configure --enable-modules=satcompute       # SCP-SatComPlate setup
./ns3 configure --help                            # Show all options
```

**Building:**

```bash
./ns3 build                                       # Build entire project
./ns3 build [target]                             # Build specific target
```

**Running:**

```bash
./ns3 run "simple-global-routing"                  # Run example program
./ns3 run "program [args]"                       # Run with arguments
```

**Testing:**

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover \
  -s contrib/satcompute/tests/unit -p 'test_*.py' -v
contrib/satcompute/tests/unit/run-cpp-tests.sh
contrib/satcompute/tests/integration/smoke/run-all.sh
contrib/satcompute/tests/integration/regression/run-all.sh
```

**Utilities:**

```bash
./ns3 clean                                      # Clean build artifacts
./ns3 show targets                               # List available targets
```

## Architecture

### Core Structure

- **`src/`** - 49 official modules (core, network, internet, wifi, lte, etc.)
- **`contrib/`** - Third-party modules
- **`examples/`** - Example programs organized by topic
- **`scratch/`** - User simulation scripts
- **`utils/`** - Development utilities

### Module Organization

Each module follows this structure:

```text
src/module-name/
├── CMakeLists.txt      # Build configuration
├── model/              # Core implementation (.cc/.h)
├── helper/             # Helper classes for easier usage
├── test/               # Unit tests
├── examples/           # Usage examples
└── doc/                # Documentation
```

### Key Design Patterns

- **Attribute System**: Configuration through TypeId attributes
- **Callback System**: Event-driven programming with Callback<> templates
- **Smart Pointers**: Extensive use of Ptr<> for memory management
- **Logging**: Hierarchical logging system with NS_LOG_*
- **Tracing**: Packet and event tracing for analysis

## Development Workflow

### Creating New Modules

```bash
./utils/create-module.py module-name    # Generate module template
```

### Code Style

The full coding style guide is documented in `doc/contributing/source/coding-style.rst`.

- **Clang-format**: Formatting rules and current C++ standard alignment are in .clang-format
- **No Unicode symbols**: Do not use Unicode mathematical symbols (e.g., ≤, ≥, ×, ÷, ∑, π) or arrows (e.g., →, ←, ⇒, ↑) in comments or Doxygen documentation; use ASCII equivalents instead (e.g., `<=`, `>=`, `*`, `/`, `->`, `=>`)

### Sphinx/reStructuredText Documentation

Full guidelines for writing model documentation in Sphinx reStructuredText are in `doc/contributing/source/models.rst`. An empty outline with the required section structure and elements for a new module can be found in `utils/create-module.py`. Note that existing modules are not yet universally conformant to this structure; when adding Sphinx documentation to an existing module, find an appropriate insertion point within the existing structure rather than restructuring the whole document.

### Doxygen Documentation

Full conventions are in `doc/contributing/source/coding-style.rst` (Comments section). Key rules:

- **Coverage**: All classes, methods, and member variables must have Doxygen comments. Exceptions: methods inherited from a parent class (docs are copied automatically) and default constructors/destructors.
- **Comment style**: Use C-style Javadoc blocks (`/** ... */`). Use `///< brief description` for inline member variable documentation.
- **Tag delimiter**: Use `@` not `\` for all tags (e.g., `@param`, `@return`, `@brief`). clang-format recognizes `@` as a Doxygen tag delimiter and formats accordingly.
- **Parameters and return values**: All must be documented with `@param` and `@return`.
- **Cross-references**: Use `@see` for cross-referencing other classes or methods.
- **Internal comments**: Use `@internal` / `@endinternal` for documentation not intended for public Doxygen output.
- **Grouping**: Use `@defgroup` and `@ingroup` to bind logically related classes within a module. Test classes should form an ancillary group with `@ingroup tests`.

Example:

```cpp
/**
 * Brief description of the class.
 */
class MyClass
{
  public:
    /**
     * Constructor.
     *
     * @param n Number of elements.
     */
    MyClass(int n);

    /**
     * Do something useful.
     *
     * @param x Input value.
     * @return Result of the operation.
     */
    int DoSomething(int x);

  private:
    int m_count; ///< Number of elements
};
```

### Testing Requirements

- SatCompute must build from a targeted configuration without globally enabling
  ns-3 examples or tests.
- Maintained tests under `contrib/satcompute/tests/` must pass before commits.
- GitHub workflows must not run `test.py` or upstream example tests.

### Commit Guidelines

- Present tense, imperative mood ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Reference modules: "core, network: Add new feature"
  - if list of edited modules spans more than two, suppress listing
- 72 character limit for first line
- Use "(fixes #issue)" for bug fixes, after the list of modules but before
  the summary of the commit, where `#issue` is the number of the issue.

## Common Development Tasks

### Running Single Tests

```bash
python3 contrib/satcompute/tests/unit/test_scenario_config.py
contrib/satcompute/tests/unit/run-cpp-tests.sh
contrib/satcompute/tests/integration/smoke/run-all.sh
```

Tests can be run with ns-3 logging enabled via the `NS_LOG` environment variable:

```bash
NS_LOG="BulkSendApplication" ./ns3 run 'test-runner --suite=applications-bulk-send'
```

Log level can be tuned to reduce noise. Note that filtering to a specific log level deselects prefix information, so `prefix_all` must be added to recover it:

```bash
NS_LOG="BulkSendApplication=level_info|prefix_all" ./ns3 run 'test-runner --suite=applications-bulk-send'
```

### Debugging

```bash
./ns3 run "program --help"              # Show program options
./ns3 run program --command-template "gdb --args %s"  # Run with gdb
```

### Building Specific Modules

```bash
./ns3 build core                        # Build only core module
./ns3 build wifi-simple-adhoc           # Build specific example
```

## Module Dependencies

When working with modules, understand the dependency hierarchy:

- **core** - Base classes, logging, attributes
- **network** - Packets, nodes, devices
- **internet** - IP, TCP, UDP protocols
- **applications** - Application layer protocols
- **wifi/lte/etc.** - Technology-specific implementations

## Python Bindings

Python bindings are available but may not cover all C++ APIs. Use:

```python
from ns import ns
help(ns.ClassName)  # Get class documentation
```
